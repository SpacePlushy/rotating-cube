# Pull Request: Version 1.0 - Interactive 3D Rotating Cube

## Description
This pull request introduces the first complete version of the 3D Rotating Cube application built with React, TypeScript, and Three.js. The application features an interactive 3D cube that users can control through both UI elements and keyboard shortcuts.

## Features
- **3D Cube Visualization**: Rendered with Three.js with proper lighting and materials
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - Color selection with presets and a color picker
  - Rotation speed adjustment with presets and a slider
  - Wireframe mode toggle
  - Manual rotation controls (buttons and keyboard)
  - Reset rotation functionality
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - Arrow keys for rotation
  - R to reset rotation
  - W to toggle wireframe mode
  - +/- to adjust speed
  - H to toggle help panel
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clear, intuitive controls with visual feedback

## Technical Implementation
- **Component Architecture**:
  - App: Main container managing state and communication between components
  - Cube: Handles 3D rendering and animation using Three.js
  - Controls: User interface for manipulating the cube
- **State Management**: Using React hooks (useState, useRef, useEffect, useCallback)
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Using refs for animation state to avoid unnecessary re-renders
  - Proper cleanup of resources and event listeners
  - Optimized animation loop
- **TypeScript Integration**: Strong typing throughout the application

## Testing
- Manual testing of all features and interactions
- Verified across different browsers and screen sizes
- Ensured proper keyboard control functionality

## Screenshots

- Performance optimizations for more complex scenes
- Accessibility improvements
- Unit and integration tests

## How to Test
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
5. Interact with the cube using both the UI controls and keyboard shortcuts
